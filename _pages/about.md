Welcome to my portfolio website!

I am a young data science professional. Currently finishing a master's degree at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). Here you can find some of my personal projects and some interesting blog posts. I am interested in many subfields within data science, mathematics and statistics.

Please take a look at [my projects](https://urjalacoder.github.io/projects) and [blog posts](https://urjalacoder.github.io/blog). Hope you find something interesting!
