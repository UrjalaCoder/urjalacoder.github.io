Welcome to my portfolio website!

I am a young data science professional. Currently finishing a master's degree at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). Here you can find some of my personal projects and some interesting blog posts. I am interested in many subfields within data science, mathematics and statistics and my projects reflect that.

The website is work-in-progress, so the content is quite empty still. You can find some of my projects on GitHub and Kaggle. Also check out the links on my LinkedIn profile!
